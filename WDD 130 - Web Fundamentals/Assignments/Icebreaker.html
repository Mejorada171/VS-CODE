    <h2>Jorge Mejorada</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My full name is Jorge Javier Mejorada Hern√°ndez, I'm 21 years old, I'm from Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico I love programming since I knew about it, I'm heading for a Web development degree I'm not going to lie sometimes I struggled learning and doing the new assignments but I've always love challenges too.
    I currently live with my family, I have my mom, my father, an older sister, a younger sister and two beutiful dogs. That's right I'm the middle one, I really like my current job, I work as a salesman in the family business.
    I love read some good books and learn more English, I'm good in chess, I love basketball and rigth now I'm trying to develop this new part of my life "Programming", I know there's a too much road to get through to become a real developer, but hey! This is a great start.</p>

   
    <p>Have fun in this adventure guys!</p>
